using '-a'.  For example, to load a SearchAgent that uses
depth first search (dfs), run the following command:

    # IDEA: Create a Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm #
    # Since we want to connect Pacman to all food dots with a lowest total cost, this problem amounts to finding a Minimum Spanning Tree in an undirected graph. We could use either Prim's or Kruskal's Algorithm here to find the MST. I have chosen Prim's Algorithm, since in this Pacman problem of adding nearest food dots to the Tree lends more intuitvely to Prim's approach than adding least weight edges to the tree through Kruskal's method. Additionally, if I were to use Kruskal's algorithm, I would have to check for cycles at each step. Finally, the return value of my heuristic is the total cost of the MST using Manhattan Distance to find the weight of edges.
